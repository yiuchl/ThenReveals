					The tetrahedron is an equilateral triangular pyramid representing
					fire, the element of manifestation and creative power. Because the
					points equally converge at the center, energy perfectly directs to a
					specific focus.
				</div>
				<div class="div2">
					The hexahedron has six square faces and facets with three meeting at
					each vertex. Its steadfast form symbolizes the element of earth, which
					is associated with soundness and materiality.Its equal sides and
					angles suggest balance and order, reflecting worldly existence.
				</div>
				<div class="div3">
					The octahedron is an eight-faced polyhedron with equilaterally
					triangular faces. Associated with the element of air, the octahedron
					represents intellect, communication, and compassion. The octahedron’s
					sharp lines and symmetry symbolize clarity of thought and higher
					consciousness.
				</div>
				<div class="div4">
					The dodecahedron has twelve pentagonal faces and is associated with

						The Platonic Solids are the most primitive, stable, and balanced
						shapes in the universe. Believed to represent the elements that make
						up the cosmos, the Platonic Solids are considered the fundamental
						building blocks of reality. These polyhedra represent a perfect
						harmony of geometry, mathematics, and philosophy.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="div7">
					<p>
						A Platonic Solid is a three-dimensional shape characterized by
						identical faces, each of which is a regular polygon, and the same
						number of faces meeting at each vertex. In other words, a regular
						convex polyhedron with congruent convex regular polygons as faces.
